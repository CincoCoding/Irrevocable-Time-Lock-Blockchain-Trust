# Project 3 Proposal
## Project Name
Irrevocable Time-Lock Blockchain Trust

## Members
Luke, David, Kyle

## Description
Our project is to create a time-lock blockchain wallet that acts as a trust. It will be adjustable on a streamlit app. Once, its set on the blockchain is is permanently set. It will provide funds other wallets on a regular scheduled basis. Adjustable features; deposit amount, withdrawals amounts, frequency, # of receiving wallets, receiving wallet addresses. The app will be connected Ganache testnet. We will use Ethereum smart contracts. 

## Technical Requirements
### Base features
0. GitHub Setup
1. Python 
    I. Streamlit text input
    II. Streamlit visualizations - David
2. Ganache
3. Solidity
4. Time-Lock Library?
5. readme.md
6. dependencies
7. add more features

### General

### Additional Features
add additional types of trusts?
add choosing coins?
should deposited money be invested or stakes (single-asset staking)
    require proof of stake for it to work?
